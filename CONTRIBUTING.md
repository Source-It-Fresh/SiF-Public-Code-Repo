## Coding Culture 
_Impact on community, internal and external, is high on the priority/checklist for the natural progression of this project._<br>
_Thoughtful and rewarding impacts will persevere._

### Communication is key:
**We** aim to instill a **culture** where no one is afraid to **point** out things they **don’t understand or to be wrong!**<br>
**Juniors** speak **first**, as we **don’t** want to **overlook** any potential legitimate **input**.

### Design Philosophy:
**Build** everything simple and then **double** up on system and component **failovers**.<br>
**Redundancy** is key! When it comes to failovers, **add to all** functions, calls, middleware, and UI layers.

### Disputes:
Do **KISS** Test: “Keep It Simple”, Don’t add unnecessary **complexity**, as it’s often a stumbling block of the future if it cannot be **justified** at **design** time.<br>
The final decision on equally weighed pros, cons and / or logical aspects goes to the most **passionate side**.

### Standards:
Build on **DRY - TDD - SOLID; Principals** for, Non-repetitive, Test covered Code that adheres to the essential design principles of writing robust maintainable software.

### Day-to-day Approach:
* **Consistency** over **correctness** - allows for easy migration to the latest **"Best Practices"**.
* Don't reinvent the wheel. Use **official legal actively maintained** 3rd party APIs / NuGet **packages** and libraries.
* First do no harm, **backwards compatible** as far as possible, **within reason**.
* **Fix** confirmed known **bugs before** adding **feature** improvements.
* **Immediately** add tests for **prod bugs** once reproduced and **fixed**.
